# CodingBootcampChallenge1 Optimalization Website

## Description

Refactored the code in the existing application to fit Acceptance Criteria for accessibility for a Marketing Agency. I included semantic html elements,
made sure the elements follow a logical structure, made alt attributes available, made sure they fell in sequential order and gave a concise, descriptive title.
